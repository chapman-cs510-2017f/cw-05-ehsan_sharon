Althuogh at some part instead of qoutation mark, the pound sign '#' is used.\n\n\n\nSK:\n\nThe functions has a description under the defintinion. \n\n\nCan you follow the algorithm of the code, i.e., what it is doing, and how? \nEY: \nThe codes are well organized but there was no additional comments or examples about how the function runs. \n\nSK: \nThere are many descitopns and examples for the functions. it is easy to follow what the function does. However, The spacing and indentation between the ''Args section'' is not based in Google Standard. \n\n\nDo you see any suggestions for how to improve the code? \nEY: \nYes, under some functions giving an example or exaplaing the sections would be very helpful. For instance under the Generator function there is no explantion for command Yield or any demo of the output of the function.\n\nSK: \nThe explanation of the modules are well documented, but it should be supplemented with more examples.\n\nAre there test cases for the code? Do the tests verify correct functionality? \n\n\nAre there tests that would have been good to include but are missing? \n\nEY: No there are no test cases\n\nSK: No there are no test cases\n\nIs the Jupyter notebook a clear discussion of the problem, solution, and outline of the algorithm used in the code? \nEY:\nIn my opinion the description of the codes are very well detailed and consices but some part of the description and details of the codes dont belong to the ducument. My suggestion is to take the details and comments on the codes to the body og the code and by applying Google documentaiont format or other format standard we can describe the codes so then we save our Jupyter notebook space to describe what the problem is, and what is the result after applying the codes.\n\nSK:\n\nOn a scale of 0-100, the reviewer should rate the work produced by the reviewee. As the reviewer writes this critique and evaluation into the Jupyter notebook, the reviewer should discuss these questions and any issues that arise with the reviewee.","cell_type":"markdown"}
